          <p>4.Inhale and lower the bar slowly until it touches your chest below your armpits. As you lower, flare your elbows out slightly.</p>

</p>
          <h1><strong><pre>2) Chest press</pre></strong></h1>
          <img style="float: right" src="chest%2020.gif" width="250">

          <p>3.As you inhale, pull the bars toward you slowly and with control, without letting the weights touch down.
</p>

          <p>1.Grab a low-resistance band and set it out on the ground.</p>
          <p>2.Stand on the middle of the band, grabbing the two ends in either hand with a pronated (overhand) grip, hinging at the hips and slightly bending your knees in an athletic stance.</p>
          <p>3.Make sure that your back isn't rounded.</p>
          <p>4.Squeeze your back to pull the band ends simultaneously to your chest, or as close as the band allows. </p>

          <h1><strong><pre>2) Renegade Row</pre></strong></h1>
          <img style="float: right" src="b%202.gif" width="250">

          <p>3.Squeeze your glutes and core to maintain a strong spinal alignment, looking at the floor ahead of you.

</p>
          <p>4.Use your lats to row one of the dumbbells to chest height, then return the weight to the ground, keeping the rest of your body balanced in its position.</p>
          <p>5.Control the load up and down the movement — if you have to contort your body and shift your back to lift the dumbbells, drop down to a lower weight.</p>
          <p>6.Perform a pushup, maintaining spinal alignment, and repeat the motion with the opposite arm.

</p>

          <p>4.Pull the dumbbell up to the side of your torso without rotating your shoulders or losing your balance.</p>
          <p>5.Pause for a count at the top before lowering the weight to the starting position.</p>

          <p>2.Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and bend your knees to lean forward and grab the handle with both hands.</p>
          <p>3.With your back flat, engage your lats to pull the weight between your legs (be careful with how deep you swing) then drive your hips forward and explosively pull the kettlebell up to shoulder height with your arms straight in front of you.</p>
          <p>4.Return to the start position and repeat without pauses.</p>

          <p>4. Pull the bar to your upper abs and squeeze your shoulder blades toward each other. </p>
          <p>5. Pause, then slowly lower the bar back to the starting position.</p>
