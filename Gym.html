        <h1><strong>Importance of Gym</strong></h1>
          <p>The first and foremost reason that gym class is so important is because of the physical activity. Gym provided us with exercise daily. While it may not of seemed like it, we became healthier, even if it was just the slightest bit. Along so, for the people who do no physical activity outside of school, they were now given the time to exercise. On top of this, so many of us take away something from gym classes. Whether it was a game that was played, a stretch, or anything, gym teaches skills that can be used throughout one's entire life. It is not just physical benefits though, gym also gives us mental benefits which helps us think and function better in our everyday lives.</p>
          
          <p>Second up, gym class helps people with their coordination and flexibility. Often times, theses two aspects are overlooked and their importance is not understood. As one gets older, coordination and flexibility take a huge decline. So establishing them in gym class, and keeping up with them throughout life can lead to a longer lifespan and a healthier one too. To further support, according to the National Association for Sport and Physical Education, the development of skills and that you learn in gym class can increase your self-esteem.</p>
